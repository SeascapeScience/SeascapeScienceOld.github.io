We swim in a sea of algorithms.<br>

<u>Life in Code</u> -
I'm going to start this week with a book recommendation.<br>
Ellen Ullman has written so many insightful and amusing essays <br>
about the culture of the coding world. <br>
A great place to start is this book:<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374534516">

Here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheats$
gigantic R studio cheatsheet</a> that was shared recently. <br>
It's a good starting point for learning to do new things in R.<br>
<br>

<u>XKCDify</u> - A somewhat more esoteric resource... <br>
Have you ever wanted to convert one of your figures to the style of the popular webcomic
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>?<br>
There is code, in multiple languages, to convert something like this:<br>
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAbAAAAEgCAYAAADVKCZpAAAABHNCSVQICAgIfAhkiAAAAAlwSFlzAAALEg$
<br>
<br>
...into something like this:<br><br>

Are you wobbly with stats? <br>
In the spirit of other resources folks have shared, here is an explanation <br>
of how to read the summary of a linear model <br>
(ala <b>model = lm(y ~ x, blah blah blah)</b>).<br>

Finally, let's finish with a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br>
These things can be helpful during a pandemic.<br>
After all, the show covered everything from
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">$
to various topics in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-r$
philosophy and cultural theory</a>.<br>
...Including algorithms:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp <i>"Robots are the strangest people."</i>

  <div style="margin-left: 1em; font-family:'Courier New'"><br>
<b>1.</b>  "<u>Compute Like an Artist</u>" is a nod to Austin Kleon, <br>
whose <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href='https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/'>newsletter</a> I lea$
such as how to "Steal Like an Artist." <br>
<i>I'm still honing my stealing practices, so bear with me</i>.<br>
The phrasing is a little clunky, but I thought it was better than<br>
"Compute Like a Thief," or "Steal Like a Computer."<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  <u>COVID forecasting</u> is everywhere now.<br>
This video from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://constancecrozier.com/2020/04/16/forecas$
Constance Crozier</a> shows a great simulation <br>
illustrating how hard it is to forecast the point at which an S-curve levels off.<br>
With COVID-19, we're still at the point where the forecast is flapping all over<br>
the place like a rogue fire hose.

<b>3.</b> I will mostly be posting resources that are less mainstream than the NYTimes,<br>
but I couldn't resist sharing
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/ai-ocean-whales-stud$
on artificial intelligence + ocean science</a>.<br>
This is the area of research I work in. The article covers the great potential <br>
of AI in ocean science.<br>
Like any technology, there are there are dangers to AI too. A topic for later.

<b>4.</b> <u>Itty Bitty Sites</u>. I don't know where all of this will lead, but for now <br>
I'm using
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://itty.bitty.site/">itty.bitty.site </a><br>
...The entire page, html etc., is embedded in the URL.<br>
 The <b>Caf&eacute Code</b> Newsletter is not actually hosted anywhere.<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b> <u>Don't forget the art</u>!  As "Steal Like an Artist" reminds me, <br>
we are in some ways a mix of all the things we surround ourselves with.<br>
I'll finish with one of my favorite data science artists,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.jillpelto.com/">Jill Pelto</a>, <br>
whose work often combines time series data with a scene of the environment that <br>
underlies that data.<br>

That's it for this week. Nick Record, signing off.
