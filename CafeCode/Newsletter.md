# Café Code

```javascript
We swim in a sea of algorithms {
   The more creativity we have in our coding, the more we have in our world {
      Compute like an artist
   }
}
```

**This is a weekly newsletter/roundup of resources that go along with our Café Code meetings.**

1. There's a lot of doomsday talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI), but the reality is that AI is already surrounding us in our everyday lives.  
I recently saw this TEDx talk on "*AI Literacy, or Why Understanding AI Will Help You Every Day*"  
Here's the talk:  
https://www.ted.com/talks/jordan_harrod_ai_literacy_or_why_understanding_ai_will_help_you_every_day  
And here is Jordan Herrod's page, if you're interested in digging deeper:

2. In the spirit of providing more and more resources, this one could be handy.  
It's a tutorial on [using R to work with NetCDF file](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/11/05/tidync/)

3. Okay, back to AI for our art! Neural networks have always been a bit of an enigma.  
I really liked this visualization of linear regression, drawn as a neural network.

**1.** Life in Code - I'm going to start this week with a book recommendation.
Ellen Ullman has written so many insightful and amusing essays 
about the culture of the coding world. 
A great place to start is this book:<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374534516">

</a><br>

**2.** Here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf">
gigantic R studio cheatsheet</a> that was shared recently. 
It's a good starting point for learning to do new things in R.<br>

**3.** XKCDify - A somewhat more esoteric resource... 
Have you ever wanted to convert one of your figures to the style of the popular webcomic
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>?
There is code, in multiple languages, to convert something like this:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/SeascapeScience/SeascapeScience.github.io/blob/master/CafeCode/images/xkcd1.png?raw=true" width=300><br>
...into something like this:<br>

Links:<br>
&nbsp <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/">
Python/Matplotlib</a><br>
&nbsp <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38499-xkcdify">
MatLab</a><br>
(As a lifelong cartoonist, I count this as art.)<br>

**4.** Are you wobbly with stats? 
In the spirit of other resources folks have shared, here is an explanation 
of how to read the summary of a linear model 
(ala <b>model = lm(y ~ x, blah blah blah)</b>).
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://feliperego.github.io/blog/2015/10/23/Interpreting-Model-Output-In-R">
QUICK GUIDE: INTERPRETING SIMPLE LINEAR MODEL OUTPUT IN R</a><br>

**5.** Finally, let's finish with a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
These things can be helpful during a pandemic.
After all, the show covered everything from
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">quarantine</a> <br>
to various topics in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-rise-of-buffy-studies/407020/">
philosophy and cultural theory</a>.<br>
...Including algorithms:<br>
