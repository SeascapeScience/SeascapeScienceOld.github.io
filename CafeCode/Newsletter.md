**1.** Life in Code - I'm going to start this week with a book recommendation.
Ellen Ullman has written so many insightful and amusing essays 
about the culture of the coding world. 
A great place to start is this book:<br>

</a><br>

**2.** Here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf">
gigantic R studio cheatsheet</a> that was shared recently. 
It's a good starting point for learning to do new things in R.<br>

**3.** XKCDify - A somewhat more esoteric resource... 
Have you ever wanted to convert one of your figures to the style of the popular webcomic
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>?
There is code, in multiple languages, to convert something like this:<br>

...into something like this:<br>

MatLab</a><br>
(As a lifelong cartoonist, I count this as art.)<br>

**4.** Are you wobbly with stats? 
In the spirit of other resources folks have shared, here is an explanation 
of how to read the summary of a linear model 
(ala <b>model = lm(y ~ x, blah blah blah)</b>).

QUICK GUIDE: INTERPRETING SIMPLE LINEAR MODEL OUTPUT IN R</a><br>

**5.** Finally, let's finish with a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
These things can be helpful during a pandemic.
After all, the show covered everything from
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">quarantine</a> <br>
to various topics in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-rise-of-buffy-studies/407020/">
philosophy and cultural theory</a>.<br>
...Including algorithms:<br>
