### This is a weekly newsletter/roundup of resources that go along with our Café Code meetings.

**2020.06.26**

1. We talked mostly about data visualization and making figures this week. We mostly focused on practical tools. Here are some resources:
   
   - Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures 
   https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833

   - Data Visualization - A practical introduction
   https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html

   - Biomedical Data Science (chapter on making plots)
   http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/plots_to_avoid.html

   - A Brief Guide to Designing Effective Figures for the Scientific Paper
   https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201102518

   - Graphs, Tables, and Figures in Scientific Publications: The Good, the Bad, and How Not to Be the Latter
   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22305731/

   - How to Display Data Badly
   https://www.jstor.org/stable/2683253?seq=1

   One interesting note is that they disagree on certain points. For example, the "Ten Rules.." paper says to use the area of a symbol to indicate magnitude. Other research says that most humans misinterpret area as an indicator of magnitude. In any case, reading through these will help you be more thoughtful when you're putting together figures.
   
2. I had heard that san-serif fonts were more accessible to visually impaired and dyslexic people. My literature search confirmned this. What I didn't know was that there are beautiful san-serif fonts designed specifically for dyslexic readers. Like this one: 
   
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDyslexic"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/OpenDyslexic3Regular-image.svg" width=300></a>
   
3. Along similar lines, here are some resources for making your figures color-blind-friendly:

   - https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr
   - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html
   - https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/

4. Switching gears, senator Angus King (ME-I) addressed our lab last night over Zoom, and I couldn't help but scan his bookshelf. (A bookshelf is irresitable to me.) He had this book "Data and Goliath" sticking out. I haven't read it, but it's cool to see some data-geekiness showing up on the shelf of a US senator.

5. To end on a fun note (not that all of this isn't fun), this figure below is rated by many, including Scientific American, as the all-time best scientific figure. I think it's up for debate, but I'll leave it here for discussion.

1. This week our coding group talked about biases in data and in the world. The most recommended resource was the **"Parable of the Polygons"**, which is an interactive simulation about how bias shapes the world. It's a great combination of modeling and visualization. [Check it out here](https://ncase.me/polygons/)

2. If you want to keep going, here are some of the other readings that went along with the session. 
   - [What is implicit bias?](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(18)30643-3.pdf)    
   - [Example of bias influencing data interpretation](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140225101143.htm)
   - [Bias influencing action](https://mcdreeamiemusings.com/blog/2019/4/1/survivorship-bias-how-lessons-from-world-war-two-affect-clinical-research-today)

3. One of the students shared the site [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news) which provides the news headlines of the day, from all the different news sources, with the bias of each news source indicated. I admit, I was surprised to see where some of them fell. But it's always interesting taking a step back to see where your own source of information fits along a spectrum of bias.

   <a href="https://www.allsides.com/"><img src="https://www.allsides.com/sites/default/files/AllSidesMediaBiasChart_Version1.1_11.18.19.jpg" width=200></a>

4. Shifting topics a little, here are two more data resources for the geosciences that were shared this morning:
   - [PanGeo: a community platform for Big Data geoscience](http://pangeo.io/)
   - [OceanParcels](https://oceanparcels.org/) - Python code for Lagrangian simulation in ocean currents
   <img src="https://oceanparcels.org/images/globcurrent_fullyseeded.gif" width=500>
   
5. And finally, today we celebrate Juneteenth.

1. **Some general resources** - Here are some of the resources people shared this week that have been helpful for getting projects started:
    - Introduction to unix/bash: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
    - Resources for digitizing data in pdf and image files: 
       - https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
       - https://pdftables.com/
       - https://transcription.si.edu
       - https://community.rstudio.com/t/need-to-extract-tables-from-a-pdf-using-r/17144
       - https://www.oldweather.org/
    - Many old figures and tables from scientific papers have already been digitized and are in the Pangaea database: https://www.pangaea.de/
    - Other ocean databases folks should be aware of: [BCO-DMO](https://www.bco-dmo.org/), [SeaBASS](https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/)
    
2.  **Algorithmic Bias** - Here is some more reading, adding to the list of reading on algorithmic bias. This is just the tip of the iceberg of course.
    - [What is algorithmic bias](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/03/26/racist-sexist-ai-deep-learning-algorithms/
)
    - [Gender shades](http://gendershades.org/overview.html)
    - [Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it’s biased against blacks.](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing
)

3.  **Climate during COVID-19** This is a bit of an aside, but I've been plotting the CO_2 anomalies this year, as compared to previous years. Everything is normalized to the first six weeks of the year. Basically, atmospheric carbon dioxide shows no notable devation from the long term noise.

Data from: ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_weekly_mlo.txt

4.  **Data visualization** - Here is the TED talk that we talked about this week. It's about ten years old now, but there are some cool thoughts on data visualization. More on this topic in the future. 
     - [The beauty of data visualization](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization/transcript)

5.  I don't know why there are always five items on these lists. It's a fine number. There are five regular solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron), and five is a Fermat prime. It also took me five minutes to think of this last item.

1. **Algorithmic Bias** - This week has been a historically important one in the US. It might seem strange if you haven't been exposed to these ideas, but altorithms are an important part of the picture, particularly in the way that they reinforce and magnify biases. Machine learning algorithms are used in everything from résumé sorting to making parole decisions. One entry point to this topic, which we discussed in our coding hour, is [this article on algorithmic bias](https://bdtechtalks.com/2018/03/26/racist-sexist-ai-deep-learning-algorithms/).

2. **Predictive Policing** - To go one step deeper, one example is how neural networks are used to try to predict crimes before they happen, and then to direct police resources to those times/places. Here are a few articles as a starting point.
   - https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/can-predictive-policing-prevent-crime-it-happens
   - https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/LAPD-Predictive-Policing-Tool-Raises-Racial-Bias-Concerns.html
   - https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/predictive-policing-explained
   - https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17285058/predictive-policing-predpol-pentagon-ai-racial-bias

3. **Here are some organizations** that are doing great things to to make coding more accessible, to build diversity in our coding communities, and to build foundations that will help push back against problems like algorithmic bias:
   - [Black Girls Code](https://girlswhocode.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdlhko-jitufjhz-r/)
   - [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com)
   - [Code2040](https://girlswhocode.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdlhko-jitufjhz-y/)
   - [CSForAll](https://girlswhocode.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdlhko-jitufjhz-j/)
   
4. **A manifesto for algorithms in the environment** - Calling something a manifesto is one way to give it swagger, I suppose. In any case, this document (linked below) was a good start at trying to build principles around responsible algorithm design as it applies to the environment. The original site for the "Biosphere Code Manifesto" doesn't seem to still be there, but this write-up in the Guardian is still around:
   - [A manifesto for algorithms in the environment](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/oct/05/a-manifesto-for-algorithms-in-the-environment)

5. **On an unrelated note**, our conversation went down a rabbit hole of how to best share data files in our new zoom-research environment. [This "what-if" blog/comic came up](https://what-if.xkcd.com/31/), along with the quote,  
   _"When - if ever - will the bandwidth of the Internet surpass that of FedEx?"_ —Johan Öbrink

1. The summer of code has started for the Café Code group. Around 20 summer interns have started, working remotely from all around the country, on projects that will involve coding and/or data for ocean science. Wish us luck!

2. Up next is a fun vocab word that came across my desk via one of the many digital communications that I'm drowning in. The word:  
_**Quantophrenia**: excessive reliance on statistics, especially in areas that are not quantifiable._ I thought of this while watching the TED talk by Susan Etlinger that the coding group shared this week: [What do we do with all this big data?](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_etlinger_what_do_we_do_with_all_this_big_data/transcript#t-26273)

3. Speaking of drowning in digital communications, many folks have moved workshops and conferences online. We're doing the same thing with Ocean Hack Week. Here are a few reflections from folks who have done this recently and taken the time to write up their lessons-learned. [PLoS article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000650), [Ecological Forecasting Initiative](https://ecoforecast.org/going-virtual-what-we-learned-from-the-efi-rcn-virtual-workshop/), [Photonics Online Meetup](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.03219.pdf)

4. This week's book recommendation comes from one of our Café Code alums.   
_Data Feminism_ by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein. Catherine D’Ignazio directs the [Data + Feminism Lab at MIT](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/); "The Data + Feminism Lab uses data and computational methods to work towards gender and racial equity, particularly as they relate to space and place."

5. Finally, since I was writing about **dark data** last time, I want to end with this amusing conversation I had last week:  
Me: "Bob, is the raw data from the 90s surveys still around?"  
Bob: "Nick … I'll send you the [published] 1997 paper.  J- A-’s data was on napkins (really)."  

   That's it for this week. Nick Record signing off.

1. There's a lot of doomsday talk about **Artificial Intelligence** (AI), but the reality is that AI is already surrounding us in our everyday lives. I recently saw this TEDx talk on "*AI Literacy, or Why Understanding AI Will Help You Every Day*"  
Here's the talk:  
https://www.ted.com/talks/jordan_harrod_ai_literacy_or_why_understanding_ai_will_help_you_every_day  
And here is Jordan Herrod's page, if you're interested in digging deeper:  
https://www.jordanharrod.com  

2. In the spirit of providing more and more resources, this one could be handy.  
It's a tutorial on [using R to work with NetCDF file](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/11/05/tidync/)

3. Okay, back to AI for our art! **Neural networks** have always been a bit of an enigma.  
I really liked this visualization of linear regression by Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti [(@ChelseaParlett)](https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett), drawn as a neural network.  
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaParlett/status/1257754533989683200">
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXRxFKwU4AAhB-x?format=jpg&name=medium" width="300"></a>

4. **Dark Data Rescue** - Dark data is the data that is collected, but buried in various ways (e.g. cardboard boxes, excel sheets, bar napkins).  
This spot in the Arctic was sampled in 1961:  
![](https://github.com/SeascapeScience/SeascapeScience.github.io/blob/master/CafeCode/images/Appolonio2011.png?raw=true)   
and the [paper was published in 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270298552_Over-Winter_Oceanographic_Profiles_in_Jones_Sound_Canadian_Arctic_Archipelago_November_1961_-_June_1962_Temperature_Salinity_Oxygen_and_Nutrients) . It's like a time machine to sample the past.  
A good starting place for dark data in the geosciences is the **Pangea database**. https://www.pangaea.de/  
And of course there's an R package for interfacing with that database. https://docs.ropensci.org/pangaear/  

5. I feel like I should have a nice Buffy quote or something to wrap up the week, but instead I'm going to drop in one last resource that came up this week. Here is a resource for **using GPU cards with R**. Hopefully we'll dig into this more later. https://github.com/cdeterman/gpuR  
  
   That's it for this week. Nick Record signing off.

**1.** **Life in Code** - I'm going to start this week with a book recommendation.
Ellen Ullman has written so many insightful and amusing essays 
about the culture of the coding world. 
A great place to start is this book:<br>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374534516">
<img src="https://github.com/SeascapeScience/SeascapeScience.github.io/blob/master/CafeCode/images/9781250181695.jpg?raw=true" width=100>
</a><br>

**2.** Here is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Cheatsheets_2019.pdf">
gigantic R studio cheatsheet</a> that was shared recently. 
It's a good starting point for learning to do new things in R.<br>

**3.** **XKCDify** - A somewhat more esoteric resource... 
Have you ever wanted to convert one of your figures to the style of the popular webcomic
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>?
There is code, in multiple languages, to convert something like this:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/SeascapeScience/SeascapeScience.github.io/blob/master/CafeCode/images/xkcd1.png?raw=true" width=300><br>
...into something like this:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/SeascapeScience/SeascapeScience.github.io/blob/master/CafeCode/images/xkcd2.png?raw=true" width=300><br>
Links:<br>
   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/10/07/xkcd-style-plots-in-matplotlib/">
Python/Matplotlib</a><br>
   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38499-xkcdify">
MatLab</a><br>
(As a lifelong cartoonist, I count this as art.)<br>

**4.** Are you wobbly with stats? 
In the spirit of other resources folks have shared, here is an explanation 
of how to read the summary of a linear model 
(ala <b>model = lm(y ~ x, blah blah blah)</b>).
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://feliperego.github.io/blog/2015/10/23/Interpreting-Model-Output-In-R">
QUICK GUIDE: INTERPRETING SIMPLE LINEAR MODEL OUTPUT IN R</a><br>

**5.** Finally, let's finish with a quote from **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**.
These things can be helpful during a pandemic.
After all, the show covered everything from
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)">quarantine</a> <br>
to various topics in
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/the-rise-of-buffy-studies/407020/">
philosophy and cultural theory</a>.<br>
...Including algorithms:<br>
    <i>"Robots are the strangest people."</i>

such as how to "Steal Like an Artist." <br>
<i>I'm still honing my stealing practices, so bear with me</i>.<br>
The phrasing is a little clunky, but I thought it was better than<br> 
"Compute Like a Thief," or "Steal Like a Computer."<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  <u>COVID forecasting</u> is everywhere now.<br> 
This video from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://constancecrozier.com/2020/04/16/forecasting-s-curves-is-hard/">
Constance Crozier</a> shows a great simulation <br>
illustrating how hard it is to forecast the point at which an S-curve levels off.<br>
With COVID-19, we're still at the point where the forecast is flapping all over<br>
the place like a rogue fire hose.
