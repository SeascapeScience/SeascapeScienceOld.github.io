## "Gelatinosity" trait

1. Empirical modeling of the gelisphere -- using predictor variables to map the carbon-to-volume 
ratio of the zooplankton community. This image shows a multiple regression model that used data from the World Ocean Atlas (temperature, O2, etc...) to estimate the carbon-to-volume numbers taken from the Copepod database.

1. Forecasting gelatinous species -- among a collection of forecasts of the various zooplankton taxa in the EcoMon dataset, the forecasting accuracy depends on the gelatinosity trait. The one exception is krill, which are probably undersampled in this dataset. Everything else falls along the line. I can't remember which forecasting algorithm we used.
